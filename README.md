# *Another* Python Calculator

A menu-driven calculator written in Python.  
It supports basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical operations, and includes simple input validation to prevent errors.

## Features
- **Basic operations**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide  
- **Advanced operations**: Modulus, Power, Square root, Factorial, Absolute value, Percentage  
- **Error handling** for invalid input and division by zero  
- **Modular structure** â€” menu and logic separated into different files for clarity

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+ (works on any modern Python version)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python app.py

## Future Improvements
- Add more mathematical operations (logarithms, trigonometry)
- Allow chained calculations without returning to the menu
- Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
